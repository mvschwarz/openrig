# PROOF — {{id}} {{title}}

> **WHO/WHEN:** the impl/QA pair that worked the slice, at slice-close — a slice is NOT done until this file exists and every `SPEC.md` proof-contract item has evidence (mapped 1:1, artifacts under `proof/`). See the `mission-slice-sop` skill + the conventions SSOT (`docs/reference/sdlc-conventions.md` in the repo, `$OPENRIG_HOME/reference/sdlc-conventions.md` on an installed package).

> **HOW (the drop verb, not hand-placement):** put media files under `proof/`, then ATTACH them with `rig proof add {{id}} --artifact-type qa --verdict PASS --candidate-sha <tip> --money-evidence "<one line>" --evidences "1" --media "screenshot-01.png"` — the drop writes the C1 header the Living Notes DELIVERED pairing joins on. Hand-placing files without a drop leaves the deliverable unpaired and `unverified`.

## What this proves

<1-3 sentences: the claim the slice made, now demonstrated>

## Artifacts (media in proof/)

Dropped via `rig proof add … --evidences … --media …` (one drop per verdict; media attached, never only hand-listed):

- proof/screenshot-01.png — <what it shows>
- proof/capture-behavior.gif — <what it shows>
- proof/command-output.txt — <what it proves>

## Residue / caveats (if any)
