# Slice {{slice_number}} — {{title}}

## Intent

{{intent}}

## Mini-requirements

1. [The fix as an observable outcome. For a bug fix this may BE the whole plan.]

## Proof contract

- [ ] [The repro no longer reproduces / the regression test pins it — captured. Pair with proof via `rig proof add … --evidences` (media attached with `--media`).]

## Repro

[Steps to reproduce]

## Expected

[Expected behavior]

## Actual

[Actual behavior]

## Impact

[Who is affected; severity]

## Fix proposal

[Optional: thinking on the fix]

> **How you work this slice (SOP):** conventions SSOT: `docs/reference/sdlc-conventions.md` (installed: `$OPENRIG_HOME/reference/sdlc-conventions.md`) — read its COMPONENT MENU first: your mission chooses the build path (the simple default flow · the wave model · the assigned rigorous overlay) and the planning rigor (the P0–P4 dial); do not assume the heavy flow unless your mission or dispatch assigns it. Full flow for the default path: the `mission-slice-sop` skill. The floor on every path: track on PROGRESS.md; evidence lands via `rig proof add` (never hand-placed); a slice is **not done** until its promised outcomes have evidence; verify with `rig scope audit`.
