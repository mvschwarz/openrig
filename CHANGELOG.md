# OpenRig Changelog

Agent-readable release notes for coding agents and human operators installing,
upgrading, or operating OpenRig.

Versioning: pre-1.0 minor releases may include contract additions,
deprecations, and behavioral changes. Breaking changes are called out explicitly.

---

## [0.3.1] - unreleased

**Status**: release candidate; awaiting lifecycle-rig staging + host upgrade.

### Summary For Installing Agents

- **Package version**: package metadata bumped at release-manager step; CLI
  reports the new version after `npm publish`.
- **Migrations**: no schema-breaking migrations in 0.3.1. Existing databases
  upgrade by running `rig daemon start`.
- **Node engines**: unchanged from 0.3.0 (CLI accepts Node `>=20`).
- **Backward compatibility**: existing CLI argument shapes, daemon route
  paths, RigSpec/AgentSpec schemas, and persisted settings remain backward
  compatible. New routes are additive. New ConfigStore keys are opt-in
  default-off.

### Claude Auto-Compaction Policy

The headline 0.3.1 feature: operator-configurable Claude session
auto-compaction with safe defaults.

- **Opt-in default-off**: with no policy configured, no behavior change. The
  daemon never sends an auto-`/compact` until the operator explicitly enables
  the policy.
- **7 new ConfigStore keys** in the `policies.claude_compaction.*` namespace
  (lockstep across CLI VALID_KEYS + daemon SETTINGS_VALID_KEYS): `enabled`,
  `threshold_percent` (strict integer 1-100), `compact_instruction` (default
  empty; appended to `/compact` slash-command args when set),
  `message_inline`, `message_file_path`, `pre_compact_instruction`,
  `post_restore_audit_instruction`. Strict validation across all source
  layers (`set/POST/env/file`) — invalid env values fall back to defaults
  with a warning to stderr rather than silently coercing.
- **5 operator-editable prompt surfaces** rendered in the
  Settings → Policies UI form: pre-compaction prep, compact instruction,
  post-compaction restore (inline), restore file path, post-restore audit.
  Daemon-owned wrappers (usage/threshold framing, trust-channel preservation,
  marker paths, read-depth enforcement, turn-boundary handshake, dedup +
  cooldown) are non-editable.
- **6-stage daemon-to-LLM lifecycle**:
  1. Pre-compact prep prompt — full-context Claude writes a mental-model
     restore map (annotated ASCII file/folder tree) before compaction
     ("save game before quit").
  2. `/compact` with operator instructions + trust-channel preservation
     embedded in args.
  3. Post-compact turn-boundary handshake — non-restorative acknowledgment
     creates an assistant-turn boundary so the subsequent restore prompt
     lands in the correct trust context.
  4. Restore prompt — explicit user-request shape; defense-in-depth
     fallback chain (marker → JSONL transcript path → session-id → generic).
  5. Compliance prompt — forces FULL/PARTIAL/NOT_READ read-depth audit
     table; counters Claude's deferred-execution + token-conservation
     instincts.
  6. Cooldown (10-minute default) — prevents re-fire while restore work
     is still consuming context.
- **PreCompact hook + SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit bridge**: the openrig-core
  plugin ships a marker-bridge that picks up pending-restore markers
  post-compaction and injects restore directives once. Templates live in
  the `claude-compaction-restore` skill and ship with the plugin.
- **Safety hardening**: SessionTransport classifies typed prompt drafts as
  attention state — auto-`/compact` retries later instead of overwriting
  human input. Send-failure does not advance dedup state (transient retry).
  Re-arm requires threshold-crossing (session must drop below threshold
  before next auto-compact).

### Library Explorer Finishing

The Library destination (skills + plugins + specs) became a fully
operator-facing surface:

- **No duplicate top-level entries**: `> SKILLS` and `> PLUGINS` rows
  removed from the top of `SpecsTreeView`. Bottom-row clicks now do
  dual-action (navigate to the matching index page + expand the tree).
- **Reorder**: Plugins above Skills.
- **OpenRig-managed skills discovery**: 32 shared skills now visible in
  the tree + on `/specs/skills` index. Previously the workspace-relative
  path lookup returned empty in production VM environments.
- **Daemon-owned library discovery API** (new):
  - `GET /api/skills/library` → consolidated `LibrarySkillPublic[]`
    (workspace + openrig-managed sources; absolute paths not leaked).
  - `GET /api/skills/:id/files/list?path=<rel>` + `/api/skills/:id/files/read?path=<rel>` —
    skill folder browse + content read.
  - `GET /api/plugins/:id/files/list?path=<rel>` + `/api/plugins/:id/files/read?path=<rel>` —
    plugin folder browse + content read.
  - `PluginEntry.skillCount` field added to plugin discovery
    serialization.
- **Real file-browser docs-browser on plugin and skill detail pages**:
  detail pages mount a `DirectoryTree` + `FileContentPanel` against the
  real plugin/skill folder. Markdown auto-renders; non-markdown files
  (e.g. `.ts`, `.json`) render as text. Folder navigation works (entering
  subfolders + listing files).
- **Rolled-up index pages**: `/specs/skills` lists all skills as flat rows
  with source label + file count + entry link. `/specs/plugins` lists all
  plugins as rows with version + runtimes + skill-count + entry link.

### Plugin Primitive v0

- **Plugin discovery**: vendored plugins under `$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/`
  (default `~/.openrig/plugins/`) are discovered, validated, and
  surfaced through `rig plugin list` + `/api/plugins`.
- **Plugin install (v0)**: explicit operator copy or symlink to
  `$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/<plugin-id>/`. A `rig plugin install
  <substrate-path>` verb is deferred to 0.3.2; see `OPENRIG-INSTALL.md`
  inside each plugin's source for the documented copy/symlink workflow.
- **CLI**: `rig plugin list` / `show` / `used-by` / `validate` subcommands
  available. No `install` subcommand at v0.
- **Plugins shipped as substrate references** (for plugin authors to
  copy-install): `gstack` (45 skills), `obra-superpowers` (14 skills).
  `openrig-core` ships bundled with the daemon (11 skills).

### Settings Destination Explorer

Settings became a 4-item Explorer destination matching Topology /
Project / Library / For-You pattern:

- `/settings` (general config keys form), `/settings/policies`,
  `/settings/log`, `/settings/status`.
- Old top-row tab nav removed.
- Shared `SettingsPageShell` chrome across all 4 sub-routes.
- Policies page is the home for the Claude auto-compaction policy form
  (see above).

### CMUX Launcher

- **Launch in CMUX button** on the rig-scope topology tab-bar trailing
  slot. Opens a cmux workspace for the rig with appropriate title +
  cwd parameters. Powered by new daemon route + cmux adapter
  extensions.

### Node-Page Overview + Details

- **Seat overview table** consolidated as 7-column horizontal layout with
  vertical grid lines (Claude/Codex agent + status + context + tokens +
  uptime + cwd + current-work).
- **Tab consolidation** + activity alignment on the node-detail surface.
- **Alert-only notification banner** (renders only on real-alert states:
  `failed`, `attention_required`, or `latestError !== null`); generic
  `recoveryGuidance` no longer triggers a banner on every seat.
- **cwd / current-work separation**: factored into a `SeatOverviewSecondary`
  primitive below the column table.

### Mobile Drawer Behavior

The Explorer drawer at 375px viewports now layers above the mobile rail
tray for Settings / Project / Library / For-You destinations
(previously hidden behind rail-tray; visible click path didn't register
on Explorer items). Topology mobile drawer is intentionally hidden in
0.3.1 (clicking the hamburger triggered a pre-existing
TopologyTableView renderer cascade); the topology mobile drawer is
scheduled for full restoration in 0.3.2 via a dedicated
TopologyTableView render-path slice.

### Plugins And Skills On The VM (Operator Note)

Operators dogfood-testing 0.3.1 should expect:

- **Stock VM install**: only `openrig-core` plugin is bundled. The
  `/specs/plugins` UI list will show one plugin until the operator
  installs additional plugins per the v0 copy workflow.
- **Skills**: 32 OpenRig-managed shared skills ship under
  `packages/daemon/specs/agents/shared/skills/` (discovered via the
  daemon skill-library API; no operator action required).
- **User-installed skills**: skills the operator installs under
  `~/.openrig/skills/` or the workspace `.openrig/skills/` directory
  surface in the same list.

### Config + Settings

Continues from 0.3.0 with the slice 08 validation pass:

- `rig config get/set/reset/list` remains the canonical CLI surface.
- Lockstep CLI `VALID_KEYS` + daemon `SETTINGS_VALID_KEYS` byte-identical
  sets (verified in slice 08).
- Help-drift CI gate from slice 08 honored across all new keys added in
  0.3.1.

### SC-29 Exceptions

The SC-29 exception process tracks explicit scope expansions to release
contracts. Exceptions declared in 0.3.1:

- **#10 (slice 24)**: cmux launcher — `POST /api/rigs/:rigId/cmux/launch`
  + CmuxLayoutService + 4 CmuxAdapter RPC methods.
- **#10 (slice 27, numbering collision)**: Claude auto-compaction policy
  — 7 `policies.claude_compaction.*` ConfigStore keys. (Numbering
  collision with #10 above is a process-only inconsistency; both code
  scopes are correctly merged. Canonical `SC29-LEDGER.md` and ledger
  hygiene scheduled for 0.3.2.)
- **#11 (slice 28)**: Library Explorer daemon API — 5 new daemon GET
  endpoints (`/api/skills/library`, `/api/skills/:id/files/list`,
  `/api/skills/:id/files/read`, `/api/plugins/:id/files/list`,
  `/api/plugins/:id/files/read`) + 2 response shape additions
  (`PluginEntry.skillCount`, `LibrarySkillPublic`).

### Known Carry-Forwards (0.3.2 Candidates)

- **`rig plugin install <substrate-path>` verb**: explicitly deferred.
  Documented copy/symlink workflow is the v0 install path.
- **Topology mobile drawer**: hidden in 0.3.1 to avoid a pre-existing
  TopologyTableView renderer cascade at 375px viewports. Full
  restoration scheduled for 0.3.2 via dedicated render-path slice.
- **Plugin source-label taxonomy**: copy-installed plugins currently
  land in the `vendored` source kind; UI label says "No user-installed
  plugins" while listing them. Taxonomy refinement scheduled for 0.3.2.
- **`SC29-LEDGER.md`**: canonical SC-29 numbering ledger document.
  Authors currently self-assign exception numbers; documented ledger
  prevents collisions like the slice 24/27 #10.
- **VM PreCompact hook installer**: the documented install path for the
  `claude-compaction-restore` skill is operator-manual at v0; an
  automated installer is a 0.3.2 candidate.
- **`docs/DESIGN.md` docs-guard violation**: pre-existing
  `npm run test:repo` failure; tracked doc outside allowed paths;
  cleanup scheduled for 0.3.2 documentation hygiene pass.
- **Environment-dependent tests**: a small number of vitest suites fail
  on developer hosts due to port-conflicts (preflight) or live host
  Claude hook state (restore-check); focused-test gates pass these
  suites; cumulative-workspace runs surface the gaps. Isolation cleanup
  scheduled for 0.3.2.

### Banked Discipline Patterns

0.3.1 surfaced a number of canonical agent-software-design patterns
during the Claude compaction iteration cycle and Library Explorer
finishing work. These are banked in operator-skill documentation for
agent-prompt design + daemon-to-LLM trust establishment:

- **Channel model**: normal user message is the only authorized action
  surface; hook stdout is informational-only; `/compact` args carry
  trust contracts that the post-compact prompt invokes.
- **Turn-boundary handshake**: when a daemon-driven action request
  would land too adjacent to local-command output, insert a
  non-committing acknowledgment message first to create an
  assistant-turn boundary.
- **Save-game-before-quit pattern**: full-context agent writes
  restoration breadcrumb before forced context loss; context-loss
  agent reads it on restore.
- **Structured-output forces completeness**: ask LLMs for explicit
  FULL/PARTIAL/NOT_READ accounting when thoroughness matters; counters
  token-conservation instincts.
- **Daemon-owned shared-resource discovery**: skill/plugin discovery
  belongs at the daemon layer with HTTP endpoint surfaces; UI consumes
  via typed API. Avoids workspace-cwd-relative path-resolution
  brittleness.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

**Status**: release candidate for public publish. This entry documents the
changes since `0.2.0`.

### Summary For Installing Agents

- **Package version**: package metadata is still `0.2.0` until the release
  manager performs the final version bump. The release contents documented here
  are the intended `0.3.0` payload.
- **Migrations**: fresh databases apply migrations through
  `039_queue_target_repo`. Existing databases migrate by running
  `rig daemon start`.
- **Node engines**: the published CLI accepts Node `>=20`. The root package and
  private daemon package remain constrained to active even-numbered Node lines.
- **Specs and primitives**: workflow specs, context packs, agent images,
  workspace scaffolds, file browsing, queue observability, context usage, and
  runtime skill discovery are all first-class product surfaces.
- **UI shell**: the operator UI has been rebuilt around the V1 shell:
  destination rail, explorer, center workspace, detail drawer, vellum surfaces,
  topology graph/table/terminal modes, and focused project observability.
- **Starter content**: `0.3.0` ships generic starter workflows and starter rigs.
  Project-specific automation recipes are intentionally not shipped in product
  source.
- **No schema-breaking release change**: existing CLI argument shapes, daemon
  route paths, RigSpec/AgentSpec schemas, and persisted settings remain
  backward compatible unless noted below.

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Confirm CLI version after the release-manager version bump
rig --version

# Confirm daemon starts and migrations apply
OPENRIG_DB=/tmp/openrig-030-verify.sqlite rig daemon start

# Confirm settings are readable
rig config list --with-source

# Confirm starter specs are visible
rig specs ls --json

# Confirm runtime identity and loaded context
rig whoami --json
```

If any verification fails, see "Failure Modes And Remediation" below.

### V1 Shell And Operator UI

The `0.3.0` UI moves from prototype surfaces to a coherent operator shell:

- Two desktop chrome regions: destination rail and explorer.
- Center workspace for full pages.
- Default-closed detail drawer for previews and referenced content.
- Topology graph/table/terminal modes at a single topology URL.
- Settings rendered as a center workspace page, not as a sidebar panel.
- Vellum surface primitives, 1px region borders, and black-glass terminal
  preview styling.
- Shared runtime graphics marks for agent/runtime/tool identity.
- Retired legacy surfaces: old sidebar shell, legacy dashboard page, and
  rig-detail drawer patterns.

### Starter Rigs And Workflows

OpenRig now ships starter content designed to be useful on a fresh install
without exposing project-specific automation recipes.

- `product-team` is the primary human-directed starter rig.
- `conveyor` is the primary workflow-oriented starter rig.
- `conveyor` includes two generic workflow specs:
  - **Conveyor**: each stage can process queued work independently, so multiple
    packets can be in flight at once and natural queue backpressure handles slow
    stages.
  - **Basic loop**: one packet advances hop-by-hop around a small loop, useful
    when the operator wants a slower, easier-to-watch workflow.
- Generic starter workflows use the workflow runtime and queue primitives. They
  are examples and building blocks, not a hidden project workflow.
- Project-specific workflow specs can still be installed from a user workspace
  or private spec directory; they do not need to be committed to product source.

### Mission-Shaped Workspace Defaults

Fresh installs now have a coherent default workspace path and scaffold:

- `rig config init-workspace` creates the default workspace structure.
- Workspace defaults include missions, slices, specs, proof/evidence locations,
  steering files, and user-editable docs.
- Existing installs are rebased at read time so newer defaults become available
  without destructive rewrites.
- Read-only mission/slice indexing supports nested mission-shaped workspaces
  while preserving compatibility with earlier flat-root layouts.

### Project Observability

Project and queue work is now easier to inspect from the UI:

- For You cards classify queue lifecycle events, shipped work, progress,
  observations, and approvals.
- Queue cards hydrate qitem bodies and proof previews.
- Story tabs emphasize qitem body content and paginate long activity streams.
- Queue rows preview bodies and open the detail drawer with full source,
  destination, state, tags, and created-time metadata.
- Tests tabs show diagnostics and proof assets when no proof is available.
- Workspace and mission rollup pages include scoped Progress, Artifacts, Queue,
  and Topology tabs.
- Current/archive grouping separates active project work from old seed or
  completed work.

### Mission Control And Queue Actions

Mission Control remains the operator surface for queue observability and
qitem actions:

- Views include personal queue, human gate, fleet, active work, recent ships,
  recent activity, and recent observations.
- Actions include approve, deny, route, annotate, hold, drop, and handoff.
- Mission Control audit outcomes are reflected back into For You cards so
  terminal or already-actioned items show evidence instead of stale controls.
- Audit browsing and action history are read-only inspection surfaces.
- Existing daemon endpoints are reused; no extra workflow-specific endpoint is
  required for the public starter content.

### Files, Markdown, Progress, And Proofs

The file and proof surfaces were expanded:

- File browser supports allowlisted roots, safe reads, asset reads, and
  conflict-checked writes.
- Markdown rendering supports frontmatter, code blocks, tables, images, and
  raw/rendered toggles.
- Progress views render status pills, hierarchy, and next-work markers.
- Proof screenshots open in an in-page viewer.
- File drawer headers, proof rows, queue related refs, and story rows use
  shared graphics marks for faster scanning.

### Workflow Runtime And Spec Library

Workflow primitives are available as general infrastructure:

- Workflow specs are cached from markdown/YAML sources.
- Workflow instances and step trails are persisted.
- Specs library includes workflow entries and graph preview.
- Slice and project story surfaces can render spec-aware topology when a slice
  is bound to a workflow instance.
- Cycle-aware traversal prevents graph rendering from hanging on looping specs.

### Context Packs And Agent Images

OpenRig now has additional reusable primitives for context and session state:

- `context_packs` package related context files into a coherent sendable bundle.
- `agent_images` capture reusable starter state from productive sessions.
- Library review surfaces can inspect these primitives and show safe summaries.
- AgentSpec startup can reference context packs and agent images.
- Resume-token data is redacted at route boundaries.

### Topology, Activity, And Context Usage

Topology is now a working operational surface rather than a static diagram:

- Graph/table/terminal views are available at the topology route.
- Host graphs can show multiple rigs on one canvas.
- Rig groups can expand/collapse, persist that state, and auto-expand for
  current rig/pod/seat URLs.
- Agent activity, queue handoffs, token telemetry, and context usage are visible
  in topology views.
- Codex context telemetry is read from local session state and reflected in
  topology table and terminal views when available.
- Detached Codex sessions can still expose the last readable context sample;
  Claude context remains running-session based.

### Terminal Preview

Terminal preview matured across several passes:

- Preview panes use existing session capture primitives.
- Compact terminal popovers are portal-mounted, clamp to viewport edges, and
  resize/reposition on scroll or viewport changes.
- The compact view strips unnecessary chrome and uses a black-glass visual
  language.
- The proof viewer and terminal preview share consistent drawer/popover
  behavior.

### Runtime Skill Discovery

Runtime skill discovery is now part of profile resolution:

- Rig-local skill references still win first.
- Skills can be discovered from runtime-specific and shared user skill roots.
- Structurally invalid `SKILL.md` files are rejected with precise reasons.
- Profile resolution surfaces rejected-skill reasons instead of treating every
  broken skill as merely missing.
- The behavior is intentionally strict: a skill must have frontmatter, non-empty
  `name`, non-empty `description`, and non-empty body content.

### CLI And Daemon Release Hardening

Several release-blocking polish items landed in the CLI/daemon:

- Transcript capture now uses bounded `tmux capture-pane` polling instead of an
  unbounded pipe file.
- `rig send` wraps delivered messages with sender/recipient context and a reply
  hint.
- Generated setup markers use OpenRig naming.
- Original runtime environment aliases keep deprecated `RIGGED_*` fallbacks for
  compatibility; newer typed settings use `OPENRIG_*` only.
- ConfigStore and SettingsStore remain lockstep for typed settings.
- No new plugin loader ships in `0.3.0`; plugin support is planned for a later
  release.

### Removed Or Not Included

- Project-specific workflow recipes are not included in product source.
- The old `demo` rig is no longer the recommended starter; public docs point to
  `product-team` and `conveyor`.
- The legacy `mental-model-ha` skill is removed from starter guidance.
- Root runtime projections such as `CLAUDE.md` are intentionally not tracked.
- Package-local `pnpm-lock.yaml` files are intentionally not restored; this repo
  uses npm workspaces and the root `package-lock.json` for release installs.
- Internal release artifacts and local dogfood packets are not part of the
  public release notes.

---

### Failure Modes And Remediation

**`rig daemon start` fails with an ABI mismatch**

- Cause: native dependencies were compiled against a different Node version.
- Remediation: use an active even-numbered Node release, or rebuild native
  dependencies from the installed package directory.

**Files browser or Progress view appears empty on a fresh install**

- Cause: workspace scaffold has not been initialized or the configured root is
  not where the operator expects.
- Remediation: run `rig config init-workspace`, then inspect
  `rig config list --with-source`.

**Mission Control views are empty**

- Expected on a rig with no queue items.
- Remediation: create or hand off a queue item, then refresh. If still empty,
  confirm daemon status and DB path with `rig daemon status` and
  `rig config get db.path`.

**A skill reference resolves as rejected**

- Cause: the target `SKILL.md` exists but failed structural validation.
- Remediation: fix the skill frontmatter and body. It must include delimited
  YAML frontmatter with non-empty `name` and `description`, followed by non-empty
  markdown body content.

**A public starter workflow is too simple for a specialized loop**

- Expected. `0.3.0` ships reusable primitives and generic starter workflows.
  Specialized workflow specs should live in user workspace or private rig
  packages.

*This changelog is written for agents and humans. It should describe public
release behavior without depending on local workspace paths or private project
packets.*
