# OpenRig Changelog

Agent-readable release notes for coding agents and human operators installing,
upgrading, or operating OpenRig.

Versioning: pre-1.0 minor releases may include contract additions,
deprecations, and behavioral changes. Breaking changes are called out explicitly.

---

## [0.3.1] - unreleased

**Status**: in-flight; draft notes accumulate per shipped slice.

### Config + settings

- `rig config get/set/reset/list` continues to be the canonical CLI surface
  for the typed config keys. No new keys added in 0.3.1; no breaking changes.
- 29 allowlisted keys total. CLI `VALID_KEYS` and daemon `SETTINGS_VALID_KEYS`
  are byte-identical sets (verified in slice 08; lockstep contract holds).
- Env override precedence is `OPENRIG_<KEY>` env var > `~/.openrig/config.json`
  > derived default. The 5 original runtime keys (`daemon.port`, `daemon.host`,
  `db.path`, `transcripts.enabled`, `transcripts.path`) additionally accept
  their `RIGGED_<KEY>` legacy alias for upgrade compatibility from pre-rename
  installs; new typed keys are `OPENRIG_<KEY>` only.
- `rig config --help` text refreshed to enumerate every top-level key
  namespace: `daemon.*`, `db.path`, `transcripts.*` (including the
  rotation-tuning keys `lines` + `poll_interval_seconds`), `workspace.*`
  (including `dogfood_evidence_root` + `operator_seat_name`), `files.allowlist`,
  `progress.scan_roots`, `ui.preview.*`, `recovery.*`, `agents.*`,
  `feed.subscriptions.*`, `runtime.codex.*`. A regression test asserts the
  help text continues to enumerate every namespace as new keys land.
- No new SC-29 EXCEPTIONs introduced by the slice 08 validation pass.

### Other slices

(slice notes accumulate here as each slice ships.)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

**Status**: release candidate for public publish. This entry documents the
changes since `0.2.0`.

### Summary For Installing Agents

- **Package version**: package metadata is still `0.2.0` until the release
  manager performs the final version bump. The release contents documented here
  are the intended `0.3.0` payload.
- **Migrations**: fresh databases apply migrations through
  `039_queue_target_repo`. Existing databases migrate by running
  `rig daemon start`.
- **Node engines**: the published CLI accepts Node `>=20`. The root package and
  private daemon package remain constrained to active even-numbered Node lines.
- **Specs and primitives**: workflow specs, context packs, agent images,
  workspace scaffolds, file browsing, queue observability, context usage, and
  runtime skill discovery are all first-class product surfaces.
- **UI shell**: the operator UI has been rebuilt around the V1 shell:
  destination rail, explorer, center workspace, detail drawer, vellum surfaces,
  topology graph/table/terminal modes, and focused project observability.
- **Starter content**: `0.3.0` ships generic starter workflows and starter rigs.
  Project-specific automation recipes are intentionally not shipped in product
  source.
- **No schema-breaking release change**: existing CLI argument shapes, daemon
  route paths, RigSpec/AgentSpec schemas, and persisted settings remain
  backward compatible unless noted below.

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Confirm CLI version after the release-manager version bump
rig --version

# Confirm daemon starts and migrations apply
OPENRIG_DB=/tmp/openrig-030-verify.sqlite rig daemon start

# Confirm settings are readable
rig config list --with-source

# Confirm starter specs are visible
rig specs ls --json

# Confirm runtime identity and loaded context
rig whoami --json
```

If any verification fails, see "Failure Modes And Remediation" below.

### V1 Shell And Operator UI

The `0.3.0` UI moves from prototype surfaces to a coherent operator shell:

- Two desktop chrome regions: destination rail and explorer.
- Center workspace for full pages.
- Default-closed detail drawer for previews and referenced content.
- Topology graph/table/terminal modes at a single topology URL.
- Settings rendered as a center workspace page, not as a sidebar panel.
- Vellum surface primitives, 1px region borders, and black-glass terminal
  preview styling.
- Shared runtime graphics marks for agent/runtime/tool identity.
- Retired legacy surfaces: old sidebar shell, legacy dashboard page, and
  rig-detail drawer patterns.

### Starter Rigs And Workflows

OpenRig now ships starter content designed to be useful on a fresh install
without exposing project-specific automation recipes.

- `product-team` is the primary human-directed starter rig.
- `conveyor` is the primary workflow-oriented starter rig.
- `conveyor` includes two generic workflow specs:
  - **Conveyor**: each stage can process queued work independently, so multiple
    packets can be in flight at once and natural queue backpressure handles slow
    stages.
  - **Basic loop**: one packet advances hop-by-hop around a small loop, useful
    when the operator wants a slower, easier-to-watch workflow.
- Generic starter workflows use the workflow runtime and queue primitives. They
  are examples and building blocks, not a hidden project workflow.
- Project-specific workflow specs can still be installed from a user workspace
  or private spec directory; they do not need to be committed to product source.

### Mission-Shaped Workspace Defaults

Fresh installs now have a coherent default workspace path and scaffold:

- `rig config init-workspace` creates the default workspace structure.
- Workspace defaults include missions, slices, specs, proof/evidence locations,
  steering files, and user-editable docs.
- Existing installs are rebased at read time so newer defaults become available
  without destructive rewrites.
- Read-only mission/slice indexing supports nested mission-shaped workspaces
  while preserving compatibility with earlier flat-root layouts.

### Project Observability

Project and queue work is now easier to inspect from the UI:

- For You cards classify queue lifecycle events, shipped work, progress,
  observations, and approvals.
- Queue cards hydrate qitem bodies and proof previews.
- Story tabs emphasize qitem body content and paginate long activity streams.
- Queue rows preview bodies and open the detail drawer with full source,
  destination, state, tags, and created-time metadata.
- Tests tabs show diagnostics and proof assets when no proof is available.
- Workspace and mission rollup pages include scoped Progress, Artifacts, Queue,
  and Topology tabs.
- Current/archive grouping separates active project work from old seed or
  completed work.

### Mission Control And Queue Actions

Mission Control remains the operator surface for queue observability and
qitem actions:

- Views include personal queue, human gate, fleet, active work, recent ships,
  recent activity, and recent observations.
- Actions include approve, deny, route, annotate, hold, drop, and handoff.
- Mission Control audit outcomes are reflected back into For You cards so
  terminal or already-actioned items show evidence instead of stale controls.
- Audit browsing and action history are read-only inspection surfaces.
- Existing daemon endpoints are reused; no extra workflow-specific endpoint is
  required for the public starter content.

### Files, Markdown, Progress, And Proofs

The file and proof surfaces were expanded:

- File browser supports allowlisted roots, safe reads, asset reads, and
  conflict-checked writes.
- Markdown rendering supports frontmatter, code blocks, tables, images, and
  raw/rendered toggles.
- Progress views render status pills, hierarchy, and next-work markers.
- Proof screenshots open in an in-page viewer.
- File drawer headers, proof rows, queue related refs, and story rows use
  shared graphics marks for faster scanning.

### Workflow Runtime And Spec Library

Workflow primitives are available as general infrastructure:

- Workflow specs are cached from markdown/YAML sources.
- Workflow instances and step trails are persisted.
- Specs library includes workflow entries and graph preview.
- Slice and project story surfaces can render spec-aware topology when a slice
  is bound to a workflow instance.
- Cycle-aware traversal prevents graph rendering from hanging on looping specs.

### Context Packs And Agent Images

OpenRig now has additional reusable primitives for context and session state:

- `context_packs` package related context files into a coherent sendable bundle.
- `agent_images` capture reusable starter state from productive sessions.
- Library review surfaces can inspect these primitives and show safe summaries.
- AgentSpec startup can reference context packs and agent images.
- Resume-token data is redacted at route boundaries.

### Topology, Activity, And Context Usage

Topology is now a working operational surface rather than a static diagram:

- Graph/table/terminal views are available at the topology route.
- Host graphs can show multiple rigs on one canvas.
- Rig groups can expand/collapse, persist that state, and auto-expand for
  current rig/pod/seat URLs.
- Agent activity, queue handoffs, token telemetry, and context usage are visible
  in topology views.
- Codex context telemetry is read from local session state and reflected in
  topology table and terminal views when available.
- Detached Codex sessions can still expose the last readable context sample;
  Claude context remains running-session based.

### Terminal Preview

Terminal preview matured across several passes:

- Preview panes use existing session capture primitives.
- Compact terminal popovers are portal-mounted, clamp to viewport edges, and
  resize/reposition on scroll or viewport changes.
- The compact view strips unnecessary chrome and uses a black-glass visual
  language.
- The proof viewer and terminal preview share consistent drawer/popover
  behavior.

### Runtime Skill Discovery

Runtime skill discovery is now part of profile resolution:

- Rig-local skill references still win first.
- Skills can be discovered from runtime-specific and shared user skill roots.
- Structurally invalid `SKILL.md` files are rejected with precise reasons.
- Profile resolution surfaces rejected-skill reasons instead of treating every
  broken skill as merely missing.
- The behavior is intentionally strict: a skill must have frontmatter, non-empty
  `name`, non-empty `description`, and non-empty body content.

### CLI And Daemon Release Hardening

Several release-blocking polish items landed in the CLI/daemon:

- Transcript capture now uses bounded `tmux capture-pane` polling instead of an
  unbounded pipe file.
- `rig send` wraps delivered messages with sender/recipient context and a reply
  hint.
- Generated setup markers use OpenRig naming.
- Original runtime environment aliases keep deprecated `RIGGED_*` fallbacks for
  compatibility; newer typed settings use `OPENRIG_*` only.
- ConfigStore and SettingsStore remain lockstep for typed settings.
- No new plugin loader ships in `0.3.0`; plugin support is planned for a later
  release.

### Removed Or Not Included

- Project-specific workflow recipes are not included in product source.
- The old `demo` rig is no longer the recommended starter; public docs point to
  `product-team` and `conveyor`.
- The legacy `mental-model-ha` skill is removed from starter guidance.
- Root runtime projections such as `CLAUDE.md` are intentionally not tracked.
- Package-local `pnpm-lock.yaml` files are intentionally not restored; this repo
  uses npm workspaces and the root `package-lock.json` for release installs.
- Internal release artifacts and local dogfood packets are not part of the
  public release notes.

### Failure Modes And Remediation

**`rig daemon start` fails with an ABI mismatch**

- Cause: native dependencies were compiled against a different Node version.
- Remediation: use an active even-numbered Node release, or rebuild native
  dependencies from the installed package directory.

**Files browser or Progress view appears empty on a fresh install**

- Cause: workspace scaffold has not been initialized or the configured root is
  not where the operator expects.
- Remediation: run `rig config init-workspace`, then inspect
  `rig config list --with-source`.

**Mission Control views are empty**

- Expected on a rig with no queue items.
- Remediation: create or hand off a queue item, then refresh. If still empty,
  confirm daemon status and DB path with `rig daemon status` and
  `rig config get db.path`.

**A skill reference resolves as rejected**

- Cause: the target `SKILL.md` exists but failed structural validation.
- Remediation: fix the skill frontmatter and body. It must include delimited
  YAML frontmatter with non-empty `name` and `description`, followed by non-empty
  markdown body content.

**A public starter workflow is too simple for a specialized loop**

- Expected. `0.3.0` ships reusable primitives and generic starter workflows.
  Specialized workflow specs should live in user workspace or private rig
  packages.
